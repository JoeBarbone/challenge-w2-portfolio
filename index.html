                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Joe Barbone. I have been in the IT industry for over 30 years. The first seven years were spent as a software developer. I have created multiple 
                    large applications such as job cost systems for machine shops and general contractors, as well as creating an entire software suite for an auto insurance broker.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Even though I would spend the next 25+ years as a systems administrator, I would frequently dabble in things like FoxPro, Visual FoxPro, Visual Basic, C# and other 
                    software development programs. With the understanding that most companies and applications are now on the internet, I have decided to take my skills to the world wide web.
                </p>
